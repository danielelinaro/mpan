# MPanSuite
This toolbox provides an interface to the circuit and power network simulator PAN. MPanSuite is written in MATLAB and comes with a precompiled library (in the `MPanSuite/mex_so` folder) that serves as the simulation engine.

### Installation

To install MPanSuite on your system, type the following commands at the MATLAB prompt:

`>> cd mpan/MPanSuite`
`>> MPanSuiteInstall`

To use MPanSuite you need to add to the MATLAB path the folder where MPanSuiteInit.m is located and then type the following command at the MATLAB prompt every time you want to use the toolbox:

`>> MPanSuiteInit`

### Examples

The `examples` folder contains the IEEE 14-bus example described in the paper.
